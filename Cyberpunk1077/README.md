The CyberPunk_1077.asm file contains our game in Assembly. It is a game developed in the style "art with characters" in the theme of a character that dodges obstacles. To play, we use the [Simulator][https://github.com/simoesusp/Processor-ICMC/tree/master/Install_Packages] presented during the course.

### During the game

In the upper left corner, there is a score counter that increases with each trio of obstacles passed (those change color every cycle, by the way!) The character represented by the character "X" is controlled with the A and D keys of the keyboard.

The objective is to go as far as possible in the game, dodging obstacles on the track/scenario. If the player does not dodge and the obstacle collides with the character, you will see our *beautiful screen* of **GAME OVER.**

### How it works? I can play?
We also recorded a [video][video] introducing the game, playing it and some implementation options! Check it out :wink:

If you really want to play... we use the simulator whose referring link is above. Instructions on its use are found in the simulator's repository, but briefly (for Windows), just "unzip" the simulator_todo_pronto_facil file, place our game file in the "simulator" folder, open the sublimetext.exe file in the simulator subdirectory, select the option "open file" in the upper left corner, go back one folder behind the current one and open the game file in sublime. So, just press F7, followed by the Home key, and play!

### Finally...

Any questions, whether about the repository and use of something here, or interest in the course and the like, contact us!
